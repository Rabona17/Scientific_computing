# Scientific computing from scratch
This repo contains numerical integration/differentiation, and PDE solver including Euler's method and 4th order Runge-Kutta solver. Everything is made from scatch using only `numpy` and `scipy`

* Differentiator implemented: `First order forward/backward/central differentiator`, `Second order central differentiator`, `Central partial differentiator`
* Integrater implemented: `Trapezoidal integrator`, `Simpson's integrator`, `Error estimator`
* PDE Solver: `Euler's method`, `forth order Runge Kutta`, `forth order Runge Kutta with adaptive step size`
